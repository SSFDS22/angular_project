# extract state to a service

What advantage do we have to extract the state to a service ?
- we can use the state in other components far apart in the component tree
- we can use the state in components through routing

Here we don't really need to use the state.
The only advantage is to show how to extract the state to a service and make the code cleaner in the @Component.

And as you know @Component should be as simple as possible. which is rarely the case in real life.
